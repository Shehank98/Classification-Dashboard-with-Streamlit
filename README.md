# Classification-Dashboard-with-Streamlit
This project is a Classifier Evaluation Dashboard built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web applications. The dashboard allows users to upload a CSV file, explore dataset characteristics, and evaluate the performance of different classifiers such as KNN, SVM, and Random Forest.
